# ListWorks

ListWorks is a small tool for Japanese language learners to quickly find, review and compare different grammatical structures (grammar cards). Every grammar card is expandable and also contains sample sentences, notes and a small guide on how it is used. ListWorks also includes instant search, which makes it extremely easy to find and compare different grammar cards.

Currently the database has only grammar from the Japanese B2.1 level, but it will be updated in the future to eventually include the most used grammar for everyday Japanese. You can view (and edit) the whole database here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DXI_J2wn7C3mDRGSWwh5lJZ0rdAArYfX30jPGm-A_Fo/

Please note that some of the sample sentences are from Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level Two Grammar, Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese and Bunka Chuukyuu Nihongo.
