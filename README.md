# ListWorks

ListWorks is a small tool for Japanese language learners to quickly find, review and compare different grammatical structures. Every grammatical structure is shown on a collapsible card, that also contains sample sentences, notes and a small guide on how it is used.

Currently the database has only grammar from the Japanese B2.1 level, but it will be updated in the future to eventually include the most used grammar from Japanese. You can view (and edit) the whole database here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DXI_J2wn7C3mDRGSWwh5lJZ0rdAArYfX30jPGm-A_Fo/

Please note that some of the sample sentences are from Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese, jgram.org, ... and ....
